# Random Walk 🐿️ on a lonely island

I need to add visuals!

A happy squirrel jumping around alone on a lonely island! This is a simulation of a random walk in 1D. Originally designed to be employed as a learning aid (interactive tool), for students of basic university statistics.

Contributions and any feedback are welcome, although the work on this is finished.
